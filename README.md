# CapstoneProject
A project given to me by Southeast Missouri State University, The program was intended to help with the process of Advising by allowing students to view and register for classes without the need of an "in person" advisor. This project was not fully completed but shows understanding of multiple languages and further web development

This program was hosted on a WAMP server and the database we used was MYSQL. The back end launguage was PHP and all front end applications were written in HTML / Javascript

In order to sucessfully run this code you will need to download the free WAMP server and have the most up to date MYSQL installed on it. You can find out how to do this using a google search of "WAMP server install" Once completed you can import the database file Via the MYSQL interface located within the server. After that has been completed you should be able to run the entire program.
NOTE: You may recieve an error that it cannot connect to MYSQL, to fix this ensure that your root password is correct in the .sql file located within the program, you may have to do this for both the ADMIN And Student
NOTE: The program is still in development and some features do not work properly
